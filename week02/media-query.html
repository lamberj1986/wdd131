            <h2>2 Nephi 2:25-27</h2>
            <p>
                25 Adam fell that men might be; and men are, 
                that they might have joy.

                <br>
                <br>

                26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, 
                that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. 
                And because that they are redeemed from the fall they 
                have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to 
                act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it 
                be by the punishment of the law at the great and last 
                day, according to the commandments which God hath given.

                <br>
                <br>

                27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all 
                things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they 
                are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great 
                Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according 
                to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all 
                men might be miserable like unto himself.

            <h2>Matthew 11:28-30</h2>
            <p>
                28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I 
                will give you rest.

                <br>
                <br>

                29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and 
                lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

                <br>
                <br>

                30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
